## Introduction Hello this is my intro! My Name is Nicolas and I am in 10th grade. I like to watch Sporting events like the Ulitmate Fighting ChamionShip and Major League Baseball.  I'm currently on the wresling team but have been working and wish to tryout for the baseball program. My Favorite Ufc fighter of all time is George "Rush" St.pierre. My favorite Movie is the Sci Fi movie War of the Worlds directed by Steven Spielberg. This is my favorite Movie because of the tension and the feeling of the unknown heavily throughout the movie.

As a person I heavily value generosity and someone being able to reciprocate if I would help them out. Which is why I would want to highlight my intrest and skill in public speaking, for example in middle school I toke on various leadership roles giving giving a total of 3 speeches in 8th grade. Although I haven't started moving towards something like that at chatsworth that is a goal I have set in place for my self. On a different note this summer I have went out of my way to try lots of new things including foods and would say my current faavorite food is a philly cheasesteak but with tomatos and lettuce. Some of my favorite memories have always been with family mainly with my older cousins as they seem to always have something fun to do.

An unfourtante thing I think would be important to note in this introduction is my procrastation as what they say is true a phone is a addiction but I always manage to get things done hopefully just in the nick of time. Changing the Subject this summer I went to my first concert which was The Weeknd's After Hours Till Dawn tour in honor of his new ablum. This concert was definitely my favorite memory this summer as The Weeknd has been my favorite Artist from a young age although he released his first mixtape in the earliest stages of my life.  My favorite song by The Weeknd is constantly changing but right now it's As you are on the album Beauty Behind the Madness.
